# Spondylurus

Various scripts that can be used to manipulate genome output files and prepare them for downstream analyses.
I have included both bash and python scripts I used, as well as the files I used them on / that were generated using the scripts in the "Supplemental_Spondylurus_Genome_Files" folder.

Additional genomic output files are included for each species as well.
